# Synco

Tiny, cross-platform wrapper around `rclone sync` that runs in a loop and can be started or stopped easily using simple scripts or shortcuts.

- Uses **rclone** to sync a local folder to a remote.
- Reads settings from `synco.json`.
- Can run once (`--once`) or continuously in a polling loop.
- Uses a `synco.pid` file for clean start/stop control.
- Minimal dependencies: Python standard library + `rclone` binary.

---

## 1. Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **rclone** installed and available in PATH
- Linux or Windows (macOS also works using Linux instructions)

---

## 2. Install rclone

### Linux

Most distributions include rclone in their repositories:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install rclone

# Arch
sudo pacman -S rclone

# Fedora
sudo dnf install rclone
```

Alternatively, download the official binary from the rclone website and place it in your PATH (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

Verify installation:

```bash
rclone version
```

---

### Windows

1. Download rclone for Windows from the official site.  
2. Extract `rclone.exe` to a folder like:
   ```
   C:\Tools\rclone
   ```
3. Add that folder to PATH:
   - Search **Environment Variables**
   - Edit **Path**
   - Add `C:\Tools\rclone`
4. Open a new PowerShell or CMD and run:

```powershell
rclone version
```

---

## 3. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/synco.git
cd synco
```

---

## 4. Project files

This repository contains:

- `main.py` – core sync engine  
- `install.sh` – Linux installer  
- `install.ps1` – Windows installer  
- `README.md` – this file  

Generated by installers:

- `venv/` – Python virtual environment  
- `start.sh` / `stop.sh` (Linux)  
- `start.bat` / `stop.bat` (Windows)

You must create:

- `synco.json` – sync configuration file

---

## 5. Configure rclone remote

```bash
rclone config
```

Test remote:
```bash
rclone ls gdrive:
```

---

## 6. Create synco.json

```json
{
  "local": "/absolute/path/to/local/folder",
  "remote": "gdrive:mybackup/folder",
  "buffer_size": "1M",
  "log_level": "ERROR",
  "bwlimit": "2M",
  "extra_flags": [
    "--delete-excluded"
  ]
}
```

---

## 7. Install & Run (Linux)

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Start syncing:
```bash
./start.sh
```

Stop syncing:
```bash
./stop.sh
```

---

## 8. Install & Run (Windows)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\install.ps1
```

Start:
```powershell
.\start.bat
```

Stop:
```powershell
.\stop.bat
```

---

## 9. Safety

`rclone sync` mirrors source exactly. Deletions propagate.

---

## 10. Uninstall

Stop Synco and delete the project folder.
